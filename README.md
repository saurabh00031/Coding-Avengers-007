Contactless System-Advance Health management

*** About project ...!! ***

As we were trying to make a contactless system which will help the needy
patient in the emergency situation.
Our web gives the perfect and accurate information about number of beds,
number of vaccines and ventilator available in the searched hospital.

Here we have created four menu's for hospital login, user login, hospital
sign in and user sign in.
For writing the information about hospital, hospital need to register 
first to our web and then through hospital sign in they can fill the 
neccesary information about hospital and their facilities.This information
is saved to our database. Here hospital needs to update their web after 
every 24 hours, so that the regular and accurate information about available
number of bedsand vaccines is being provided.

Now for user it is neccesity that he must register to our website to avail
the benefits of our web. 
Through users sign in the users are taken to the page where all raw data 
about register hospitals is present. From there the user can search for a 
particular hospital by the city name of that hospital.This will instantly
give user the information about availability of number of beds and ventilator
along with numberof vaccines.
The correct and updated information will be available at every 24 hours.
This will help the patient members to find the right hospital which has 
availability of beds near to them.

This will reduce the time spam in searching for a hospital and will definitely
help patient in his critical situation.
